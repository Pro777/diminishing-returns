Readiness is LOW because: (1) open_questions are accumulating (1 -> 3 -> 5), giving oq_score = 0.1, (2) next_actions are vague ('explore', 'consider'). The conversation is not stuck (still producing new claims) but is not converging either. CONTINUE is correct — the questions need answers, not more rounds of the same discussion."
