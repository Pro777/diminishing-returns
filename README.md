# Diminishing Returns

**Two ideas enter. One decision leaves.**

A small utility for measuring **diminishing returns** in multi-agent / multi-LLM conversations.

This is **not “confidence.”** It’s a stop/ship signal: *are we still producing novel, decision-relevant information?*

---

## What it measures (v0.1)

A weighted score from observable transcript signals:

- 🧠 **Semantic convergence**: are two agents saying the same thing?
- ✨ **Novelty rate**: are we still generating net-new claims?
- 🧱 **Structural agreement**: are agents modifying each other or just rephrasing?
- 🛠️ **Action readiness**: are we asking more questions or ready to execute?

> Design note: a conversation can converge on the wrong answer. DR measures *diminishing returns*, not truth.

## Why

Teams waste cycles in “one more round” loops.

A diminishing-returns meter nudges you toward the next correct move:

- ✅ **name the decision**
- ✅ **assign the next action**
- ✅ **run verification** (tests, reproduce steps, check evidence)

## Quick start

```bash
# install
python -m pip install diminishing-returns

# score a transcript
# (see spec/transcript.v0.1.schema.json)
dr score transcript.json
```

## Output

```json
{
  "score": 0.92,
  "components": {
    "semantic_similarity": null,
    "novelty_rate": 0.10,
    "structural_agreement": null,
    "action_readiness": null
  },
  "novelty_by_round": [
    {"round": 1, "claims": 8, "new_claims": 8},
    {"round": 2, "claims": 6, "new_claims": 3},
    {"round": 3, "claims": 5, "new_claims": 2},
    {"round": 4, "claims": 4, "new_claims": 1}
  ],
  "hint": "Mostly converged; move to implementation and verification."
}
```

## Examples

- `examples/transcript.meeting-stop.json` — **When to stop a meeting** (universal metaphor)
- `examples/transcript.ship-of-theseus.json` — **Ship of Theseus** (artifact identity / provenance)

Each example includes a `diminishing_returns_note.recommended_stop_round` to make expected behavior explicit.
