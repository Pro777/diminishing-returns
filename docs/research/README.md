# Research packets

This folder holds **long-form research notes** (literature scans, annotated bibliographies, synthesis memos).

If you’re new here, start with:
- `../rubric.md` — what DR measures and why
- `../roadmap.md` — where the project is going

## Index
- `diminishing-returns-academic-research-2026-02-10.md` — stopping rules, sequential analysis, early stopping, bandits, and evaluation framing
- `rpo-academic-research-2026-02-10.md` — RPO-adjacent research (structured prompting, prompt-as-code, constrained outputs)
